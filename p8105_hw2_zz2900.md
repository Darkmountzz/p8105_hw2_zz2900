### Problem 1

Below we import and clean data from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. The process begins with
data import, updates variable names, and selects the columns that will
be used in later parts fo this problem. We update `entry` from `yes` /
`no` to a logical variable. As part of data import, we specify that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7.

``` r
Transit = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

As it stands, these data are not “tidy”: route number should be a
variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would
need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be
useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number
of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
Transit %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>   
##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
## # … with 455 more rows
```

The next code chunk is similar, but filters according to ADA compliance
as an initial step. This produces a dataframe in which the number of
rows is the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
Transit %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 84 × 2
##    station_name                   line           
##    <chr>                          <chr>          
##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
## # … with 74 more rows
```

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not allow
vending. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable – this logical, so
taking the mean will produce the desired proportion (recall that R will
coerce logical to numeric in cases like this).

``` r
Transit %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A
train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first
step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert
`route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from
previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and
on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes
with the required stations in rows).

``` r
Transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 60 × 2
##    station_name                  line           
##    <chr>                         <chr>          
##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle
##  2 125th St                      8 Avenue       
##  3 145th St                      8 Avenue       
##  4 14th St                       8 Avenue       
##  5 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue       
##  6 175th St                      8 Avenue       
##  7 181st St                      8 Avenue       
##  8 190th St                      8 Avenue       
##  9 34th St                       8 Avenue       
## 10 42nd St                       8 Avenue       
## # … with 50 more rows
```

``` r
Transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 17 × 2

# Problem 2

First Step: Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
# The mutate function indicates which sheet is from
# The row with pic was excluded
Trash_data = read_excel(
  "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
  sheet ="Mr. Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:N549"
) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls, sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0))) %>% 
  mutate(group = 1 ) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

Second Step:Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
Professor_data = read_excel(
  "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet ="Professor Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(group = 2)
```

Third Step: Combine two dataset and do calculation

``` r
merge_data = bind_rows(Trash_data, Professor_data)
total = filter(merge_data, group == "2") %>%
  pull(weight_tons)
ball = filter(merge_data , group == "1"& year == "2020") %>% 
  pull(sports_balls)
```

For the first data set, Mr. Trash Wheel contains 547 observations with
15 variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered,
group

For the second data set, Professor Trash Wheel contains 94 observations
with 14 variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, homes_powered, group

For the merge data set, it contains 641 observations with 15 variables:
dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, group

Therefore, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
is 190.12 tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr.Trash
Wheel in 2020 is 856.

## Problem 3

First Step: Clean data in pols-month.csv.

``` r
pols_month = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv",show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month","day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.integer(month),
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = month.name[month]
  ) %>% 
  mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop == 0, "dem", "gop")) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

Second Step: Clean data in snp.csv.

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month","day")) %>%
  mutate(month = as.integer(month),
         month = month.name[month],
         day = as.integer(day),
         year = as.integer(year),
         year = ifelse(year > 2021, year - 100, year)) %>%
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month) %>%
  arrange(year, month)
```

Third Step: Tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemploy = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[match(month,month.abb)])
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
merge_data = left_join(pols_month, snp) %>% left_join(unemploy) 
```

Therefore:

For the pols_month dataset, the dimension of the dataset is 822, 9, the
range of years is 1947, 2015, the key variables contains year, month,
gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president.

For the snp dataset, the dimension of the dataset is 787, 3, the range
of years is 1950, 2015, the key variables contains year, month, close.

For the unemployment dataset, the dimension of the dataset is 816, 3,
the range of years is 1948, 2015, the key variables contains year,
month, unemployment.

For the merging datasets, the dimension of the dataset is 822, 11, the
range of years is 1947, 2015, the key variables contains year, month,
gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close,
unemployment.
