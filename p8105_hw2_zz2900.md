### Problem 1

Import and clean data

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

This dataset contains entrance and exit information for each listed
subway station in New York City, and it has 1868 observations and 32
rows.

Column names are formatted and forced to lowercase, 20 variables are
selected from the original dataset, including line, station name,
station latitude and longitude, whether the route (1-11) stops at that
station, entry type, entry or exit, vending and ADA compliance.

The resulting dataset now contains 1868 rows and 20 columns.

``` r
nyc_transit %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>   
##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
## # … with 455 more rows
```

So there are 465 distinct stations.

``` r
nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 84 × 2
##    station_name                   line           
##    <chr>                          <chr>          
##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
## # … with 74 more rows
```

So there are 84 stations are ADA compliant.

Compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance

``` r
nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A
train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant.

``` r
nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 60 × 2
##    station_name                  line           
##    <chr>                         <chr>          
##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle
##  2 125th St                      8 Avenue       
##  3 145th St                      8 Avenue       
##  4 14th St                       8 Avenue       
##  5 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue       
##  6 175th St                      8 Avenue       
##  7 181st St                      8 Avenue       
##  8 190th St                      8 Avenue       
##  9 34th St                       8 Avenue       
## 10 42nd St                       8 Avenue       
## # … with 50 more rows

nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 17 × 2
##    station_name                  line            
##    <chr>                         <chr>           
##  1 14th St                       8 Avenue        
##  2 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue        
##  3 175th St                      8 Avenue        
##  4 34th St                       8 Avenue        
##  5 42nd St                       8 Avenue        
##  6 59th St                       8 Avenue        
##  7 Inwood - 207th St             8 Avenue        
##  8 West 4th St                   8 Avenue        
##  9 World Trade Center            8 Avenue        
## 10 Times Square-42nd St          Broadway        
## 11 59th St-Columbus Circle       Broadway-7th Ave
## 12 Times Square                  Broadway-7th Ave
## 13 8th Av                        Canarsie        
## 14 Franklin Av                   Franklin        
## 15 Euclid Av                     Fulton          
## 16 Franklin Av                   Fulton          
## 17 Howard Beach                  Rockaway
```

Therefore, there are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train, and 17
of them are ADA compliant.

# Problem 2

First Step: Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
Trash_data = read_excel(
  "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
  sheet ="Mr. Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:N549"
) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls, sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0))) %>% 
  mutate(group = 1 ) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

Second Step:Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
Professor_data = read_excel(
  "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet ="Professor Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(group = 2)
```

Third Step: Combine two dataset and do calculation

``` r
Combine_data = bind_rows(Trash_data, Professor_data)

total_weight = filter(Combine_data, group == "2") %>%
  pull(weight_tons)

number_balls = filter(Combine_data , group == "1"& year == "2020") %>% 
  pull(sports_balls)
```

Data set Mr. Trash Wheel contains 547 observations with 15 variables:
dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, group

Data set Professor Trash Wheel contains 94 observations with 14
variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, homes_powered, group

For the combine data set, it contains 641 observations with 15
variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, group

Therefore, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
is 190.12 tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr.Trash
Wheel in 2020 is 856.

## Problem 3

First Step: Clean data in pols-month.csv.

``` r
pols_month = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv",show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month","day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = month.name[month],
    year = as.integer(year)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop == 0, "dem", "gop")) %>%
  select(c(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day))
```

Second Step: Clean data in snp.csv.

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month","day")) %>%
  mutate(month = as.integer(month),
         month = month.name[month],
         year = as.integer(year),
         day = as.integer(day),
         year = ifelse(year > 2021, year - 100, year)) %>%
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month) 
```

Third Step: Tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[match(month,month.abb)]
  )
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
merge_data = left_join(pols_month, snp) %>% left_join(unemployment) 
```

Therefore:

For the pols_month dataset, the dimension of the dataset is 822, 9, the
key variables contains year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
sen_dem, rep_dem, president, the range of years is 1947, 2015.

For the snp dataset, the dimension of the dataset is 787, 3, the key
variables contains year, month, close, the range of years is 1950, 2015.

For the unemployment dataset, the dimension of the dataset is 816, 3,
the key variables contains year, month, unemployment, the range of years
is 1948, 2015.

For the merging datasets, the dimension of the dataset is 822, 11, the
key variables contains year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, unemployment, the range of years is
1947, 2015.
